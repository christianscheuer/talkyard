  // Specify Test Files
  // ==================

  // from which `wdio` was called. Notice that, if you are calling `wdio` from an
  // NPM script (see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) then the current working
  // directory is where your package.json resides, so `wdio` will be called from there.

  // ============
  // Capabilities
  // ============
  // Define your capabilities here. WebdriverIO can run multiple capabilties at the same
  // time. Depending on the number of capabilities, WebdriverIO launches several test
  // sessions. Within your capabilities you can overwrite the spec and exclude option in
  // order to group specific specs to a specific capability.

  // If you have trouble getting all important capabilities together, check out the
  // Sauce Labs platform configurator - a great tool to configure your capabilities:
  // https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/platforms-configurator

  // resolved to continue.

  // Gets executed once before all workers get launched.
  // onPrepare: function (config, capabilities) {
